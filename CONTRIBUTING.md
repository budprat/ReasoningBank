## Development Process

### Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ReasoningBank.git
cd ReasoningBank

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .[dev]

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=reasoningbank --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_config.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Code Style

We use Black for code formatting and follow PEP 8 guidelines:

```bash
# Format code
black reasoningbank tests

# Check linting
flake8 reasoningbank tests

# Type checking
mypy reasoningbank
```

### Writing Tests

* Write unit tests for all new functionality
* Place tests in appropriate directories:
  * `tests/unit/` - Unit tests for individual components
  * `tests/integration/` - Integration tests
  * `tests/e2e/` - End-to-end tests
* Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
* Include both positive and negative test cases
* Mock external API calls to avoid rate limits and costs

### Documentation

* Update README.md if you change functionality
* Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
* Use Google-style docstrings
* Update API documentation if you change interfaces
